Script Bugs:

1. Our scripts was written in a way that work with single module maven projects,
did not work with multi-module projects (Fixed)
2. PDFBOX has many binary file changes in the history, so our splitting-by-hunk
scripts used to not working on it (Fixed)
3. PDFBOX has many test resources files that have special characters in the
file names, our splitting script was not working (Fixed)
4. Commons-configuration does not ignore target dir in their repo, our processing
script stuck there. (Fixed)
5. There is one example (CALCITE-655) in our repo does not work with CSlicer
because the tests fail when run with Jacoco. We have only tried running Definer on
this example before. (Ingored this example for now)
6. PDFBOX-3069 exposed a bug in CSlicer, it seems to be related to changedistiller,
the library we used to extract AST changes.
